#### Description: A recreation of a provided tip calculator built using Next.JS
#### Peer Reviewer: Adrian Martinez
#### Review Notes: Overall thoughts are that the styling and layout of the app is similar to the design images of the assignment, the inputs work when numbers are added, and even display invalid text when the input has zeroes in it, the reset button only working when all input fields have a value is great, and the tip buttons are toggleable when selected, plus the tip calculations work as intended, even able to match the completed design calculations. There's mostly one issue, whether if this was overlooked, but negative values can be passed through the input fields, meaning the calculations can come out incorrect. Other than that, good work!
